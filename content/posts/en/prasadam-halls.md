Within ISKCON territory there are many hotels or "bhawan" in Bengali. In some of them you can have a great lunch, and not only that...

If you really want to taste an authentic Bengali food, then you need to take lunch in one of those bhawans. There are 4 big Prasadam Halls: Gita bhawan, Gada bhawan, Sulabh Hall and Anna Dan Complex.

But before you can take prasadam first you need to buy a coupon, preferably a day before. You can obtain coupon at the reception of the hall that you want to go to. The price for lunch is 70 rupees.  It includes rice, dahl, sabji, chutney and chapati. Thali, or many small preparations on big plate is 120 rupees.  After you have purchased a coupon, you need to go the chosen Bhawan at a certain time (usually 13.00) and stand in the queue.  The line is long, but it goes fast.  In general, the organization of these dinners is simply amazing.  The devotees there have already created a whole prasadam distribution system, and normally they can feed several thousand people!  Everything is done quickly and accurately.  And everything is clean!

In Sulabh Hall, you can also have breakfast (from 9-00 to 11-00), breakfast costs 30 rupees, the portion size is not limited, you can take additional portions. Sometimes it is moderately spicy, sometimes very spicy.

During main holidays, pilgrims are fed in several shifts. So, now your turn has come and you are entering a prasadam hall. Sit down and devotees will bring everything to you. The plate is organic, it's made of banana leaves, so there is minimum garbage and harm. By the way, if you have any kind of festive event planned (wedding or birthday) and you need to feed a large amount of people, then you can order prasadam in Sulabh kitchen. The menu is very diverse and prasadam can be ordered according to your preferences.  Large selection of snacks, sweets, drinks is also present.
